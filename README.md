# Image Classification using TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple example of building and training an image classification model using TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify flower images into different categories.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy


## Project Overview

The flower classifier project comprises the following main steps:

1. *Loading and Preprocessing Data:* Flower images are loaded using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` with data augmentation techniques applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize from the limited training data.

2. *Model Architecture:* A CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow's Sequential API. The model architecture involves convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for down-sampling, and a fully connected layer for classification.

3. *Compiling the Model:* The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks like this.

4. *Training the Model:* The model is trained using the provided training dataset. During training, the model's performance is monitored using a separate validation dataset to prevent overfitting.

5. *Saving the Model:* Once training is complete, the model's architecture and learned weights are saved in the `flower_classifier_model.h5` file. This saved model can be used for inference on new flower images.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


2. Run the provided code in a Python environment. Make sure to adjust the paths and hyperparameters according to your setup.
3. After running the code, the trained model will be saved as flower_classifier_model.h5.
